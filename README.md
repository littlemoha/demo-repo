My name is Mohamed Obid, I'm 23-year-old pursuing a degree in electrical engineering, with plans to graduate in May 2024.
I manage the dual roles of being a full-time student and a full-time employee. 
In my free time, I have a passion for playing soccer, and I cherish spending quality time with friends and family.
